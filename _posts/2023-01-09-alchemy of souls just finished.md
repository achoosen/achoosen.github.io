damn. im just really sad that the kdrama â€˜alchemy of soulsâ€™ has just finished. its last episode (Season 2 Episode 10) just premiered yesterday.

I watched it during my vacation because my Dad recommended it to me (if my dad likes it then there must be something). Initially, I refused to watch the show without actually reading the premise until I was bored which led me to finally decide to read the premise and it couldnâ€™t be more promising.

The first episode of S1 was genius. I definitely did not expect the twist at the ending, not only it was unexpected but also quite beautiful in its meaning. It was what hooked me in the first place.

If you are interested, it is about a powerful assassin who became a weak servant and along the way, she met a man from a powerful family.

The first season leans more towards to the comedy and fun aspect of the story with some seriousness in it while the second season is focused on the romance and the plot action. I love the two seasons equally in my heart but I like the first season tiny bit better. The first season which has 20 episodes really took its time exploring the charactersâ€™ relationships and building the world of â€˜Alchemy of Soulsâ€™.

Just watch this highlight of the S1â€™s funny scene and youâ€™ll understand.

Though probably no one from the cast / show producer itself will ever read this, I thank the show for entertaining my holiday.
The question now is how am I gonna move on from the show? ðŸ˜­. Welp, just gonna be watching the castsâ€™ playing games from The Swoonâ€™s YouTube channel then.

Mu-Deok (Jung So-Min)'s facial expression lives in my head rent-free.
