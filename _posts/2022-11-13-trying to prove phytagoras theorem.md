suddenly it occurred in my mind, how do you get the value of a hypotenuse in a right angled triangle without using the famous phytagoras’ theorem?

–

I started off by trying to see whether yknow if you could actually compile squares to make up giant squares to prove that $$a^2+b^2=c^2$$

I’m well aware that the area of a and b combined will make a larger square that is c. However I found out that this is difficult for me to do, so again I went back to the right angled triangle.

Minutes passed by, and I had no idea. I felt the urge to search up in the internet but thats not my intention in the first place.

I then drew a square with an X cross, it formed 4 45°-45°-90° triangles. Then I noticed, what happens if I just draw a square with a diagonal. That was it. I made it remain as it is for minutes. Then I realized.. what happens if I make a square out of the diagonals? These diagonals can make a tilted square. As you can see, this is what I get.

To make it easier for me to imagine, I used the famous 3,4,5 triangle. And the results was very close.

Summing up all the triangles’ area gives me 6*4=24. And the large square is (3+3)*(4+4)=48. To get the shaded area, 48-24 is 24. But we are here to find c, so square root of 24 is 4.89 or 4.9. So very very close.

This was not yet done. We need to make it exactly 5. At this point, I gave up. So I searched up in Internet. And I realized, that I forgot to make all the lengths the same, after all, this is a square which has all the sides the same. So I made all the sides in length of (3+4) or 7.

This will gives us the area of a large square of 49. And the sum of all the triangles’ area remains as 24. 49-24 is 25. Square root of 25 is 5. And hence, we have proven the Phytagoras’ Theorem.
