finally my school implemented full day school in a week (except friday). 2 years and a half of pandemic has made all of us comfortable sitting on our desks (or whatever place you work on). irritancy are always common whenever we get out of the comfort zone but whether it is for the greater good or worse, that’s a question we will uncover.

# morning
so my school starts at 7:30, during home based learning i would wake up at 6:30-7:00am but because it is offline now, i have to wake up at 6:00am and go to school before 7:10+ ish aka traffic. obviously it was a hassle but you get used to it after days.

the school canteen is literally empty in the morning added with the fact that not everyone goes to school so if i get to school early, i get to eat my breakfast, work on unfinished assignments, or catch up on the latest badminton matches.

# classes (most boring part)
zzzzzzzzzzzzzz

i categorize my subjects in 3 different levels:

1. major

this weekday’s schedule is literally filled with subjects that i deem as major hence the focus needed to get by the day

2. minor

i’ve had a horrible experience underestimating a subject so im not even going to try calling them easy instead i’ll call these subjects as minor. these subjects are the ones i can enjoy the day, have fun, and try to get the things done so it doesnt become as a hassle.

3. bruh

yes. THESE ARE THE SUBJECTS THAT OVERCOMPLICATES THINGS/1212515414%%%%%!!! aka useless

# pros
anyways besides whether i find the subject is boring, useless, or annoying, there are things that i noticed in all of the classes i took

1. communication

so long the internet discrepancies because you’re literally in one room with the teacher.

2. activities that you couldn’t do because of the pandemic

an easy example would be PE class which by the way, it still blows my mind the fact that we managed to have PE class during the pandemic through video call (obviously ruined the spark of the class). when we finally got back to school, we got to use the facilities again, playing football, running, swimming pool, and all that.

3. attention span

lets be honest with ourselves here, how often do we look at another part of the screen or device? probably a lot. this one’s self-explanatory.

# cons
here’s the thing about disadvantages, over time you’ll get used to it and forget about it.

1. waking up early

remember the days we can wake up 10 mins before school starts yet no one can tell except the ones who are close?

2. have to wear mask all-day (except lunch)

this one is inevitable for sure, just have to wait until the whole world gets better.

3. COVID-19

self-opinion: if you are not afraid to go to malls or restaurants, then why are you still hesitant going to school? going to the malls / public places quite often or regularly means you actually can and trust with the protocols and regulations.

# conclusion
it is rather unfortunate that there are still people who have not yet go to school. i know people have their reasons so all i can say is just, when you can, go to school physically.
