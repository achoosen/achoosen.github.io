All the great athletes make it look easy. In remarkable fashion, they seem to never stop winning. Even at moments of adversity, they always find a way to overcome them. Since I started playing badminton in 7th grade, I've always dreamed to be like them. 

Then I got the chance to compete at my own school, in front of everyone. The warmup became the longest warmup I've ever had in my life. Suddenly, the match was about to start. There were cheers, this was unfamiliar. We started with a lead. 2-0. 

2-2. 
Okay, just some mistakes, it's okay. The opponent did a drive serve on me. The shuttle was so fast, I couldn't return them, my natural instinct somehow was to use a backhand rather than forehand. I knew I had to start attacking but my body won't let me. I didn't want to risk hitting the net. 

There was a chance for me to hit an easy winner in front of the net but you guessed it, I missed it.

My plan to stay in the back and be the one to attack, I completely forgot about them. In my mind, I knew I wasn't like my usual self. 

We lost the first game. I was still optimistic, I made a note to myself, I could not afford to play loose. I couldn't give any opportunities for our opponents to attack. 

When the second game began, I was rushing. I wasn't paying attention to my opponents, I was more focused on not messing up. 

Our chances of winning was dim. 11-18. Do I want to lose? Well I can't say much but out of luck, we managed to came back to 19-18.

This was our chance, to grab victory. 19-19. I had done it all during my 'training', coming back from point deficits. But it was now my turn to receive. The service situation is very important. And as expected, it was a drive serve, I was prepared with my forehand but unfortunately, it hit the net. 

And yes, we lost 19-21 on the second game.

What I've shared you was my experience competing on my second inter-school competition. My first one was 4 years ago, I was grade 8, and it was way worse. 

Morten Frost once said that confidence has to be earned along the way. And I fully agree. Playing competitively is a different ball game. You're going against your opponents and yourself. And it was clear that I haven't resolved my own problems. 

To end on a positive note, I did managed to earn my very first victory in an inter-school competition though we were playing while trying to move on from our previous loss. And I still have a chance to compete more though that depends on what the future holds for me.

Yet throughout my experience participating in badminton competitions, I realized I was wrong. As Morten Frost once said in his video, self-confidence has to be earned. It isn't something innate. Sure, you can maybe pull off the same shots that they do but the real test is in the real matches.

I started realizing this back in Grade 8. I had only just started playing badminton for a year and yet I accidentally signed myself up in a competition filled with opponents beyond my grade level. And the level they play at were just a level above. Not to mention, our jersey was our school's PE uniform which looked super lame (I admit it was my idea but to my defense, we did not have matching clothes). Our confidence was at an all-time low. But a senior of ours who volunteered to be our coach, who also competed in the men's singles, tried to cool us down. 

When our time was up, it was time to be serious except that we got so nervous, we forgot to attack. Our mind went blank yet our bodies mutually agreed to just lift the shuttle. Perhaps our abilities to return some of their attacks did inspire some confidence (it was just pure luck and reflex) but it wasn't enough.
 
I do distinctly remember being able to pull off a rally where I managed to lure our opponent and place the shuttle to the empty space.

In the end, we lost all of our matches. Our match results weren't great, we'd get scores alike to 5-21. We couldn't challenge anyone.

It was Day 1, and we had two more matches for Day 2 to complete the Round Robin however we decided to withdraw as my partner refused to play for Day 2, having lost all of his confidence. 

# 4 years later...

Ever since the pandemic hit, I never got a chance to compete but I continued to play, considering it as my training. When the opportunity to compete in my school came, I had to take it. I wanted to redeem my previous loss. I played mixed doubles with a familiar partner. The training prior to the match went very well, I played how I wanted to play at the rear court (as the male player, they are usually assigned to play at the rear court).

We had two opponents for the tournament. Our first match was against a formidable opponent. The male player was at the level of the opponents I played back in 8th grade. Except this time I'm the senior, 12th grade, and he's still in grade 10 (I only knew this after the match). Considering we don't lose the next match, this was a 'do or die' match to ensure first place victory.

This was just my second competition and everyone I knew seemed to be there, watching me. In the past, there was no one to watch us.The task I had was tough. 

The first game, I was holding on to my nerves, my hands were shaking. We lost the first game but at least, the score was respectable, 16-21. During the break, there was a moment for reflection. You guessed it, I completely forgot about the whole plan of wanting to play agressive at the rear court. 

While I got myself warm for the second game, I wasn't playing like my usual self. I wasn't looking at my opponents in the front of my eyes, I was simply just doing sequence of shots that my brain has planned without paying attention to the surroundings.

I eventually woke up, trailing behind 11-18 in the second game. I didn't want to lose without honor. This motivation helped us come back from 11-18 to 19-18. Suddenly, there was hope. Unfortunately, we failed. Though I've lost, I've earned a greater confidence.   

On our last match of the tournament, I actually managed to play how I wanted to play, earning us the second place.
