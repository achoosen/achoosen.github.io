So this was an excerpt of my working for my Math midterm exam. As you can see, I managed to perfectly prove how $$2 tan2sin2x =1$$ can be written as $$ 2 sin4x + sin2x -1=0$$ for problem 10i. However careless mistake prevented me from getting a full mark for Problem 10. The equation that was supposed to be written as

$$
2b^2+b-1=0
$$

I accidentally put a ‚Äú-‚Äù operator next to the second term resulting in a whole different solution.

$$
2b^2-b-1=0
$$

Here‚Äôs what gets even more frustrating. I factorized the equation above incorrectly üòÇü§¶.

I expanded it to $$(-2b+1)(b+1)=0$$ which does not make sense since it would mean that the first term would be a negative when it isn‚Äôt.

Conclusion: Don‚Äôt rush whenever you are solving, take your time by not being too slow or too fast. Find the right balance.

<summary>The actual solution:</summary>

Note: $$ 0 < x < 360 $$ in degrees.
$$ \text{let b} = \sin^2(x)$$

$$
2b^2+b-1=0
\\(2b-1)(b+1)=0
\\ b=\dfrac{1}{2}, b=-1
\\ \sin^2(x) = \dfrac{1}{2}, \sin^2(x) = -1
\\ \sin x = \pm\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \sin x = \sqrt{-1}
\\ x = 45, 135, 225, 315
