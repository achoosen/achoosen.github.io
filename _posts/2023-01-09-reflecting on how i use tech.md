So recently my dad upgraded his 2018 ipad pro 12.9″ to a 2021 version, he decided to hand me the unused iPad to me. Without much further ado, I just accepted the offer.

Before the offer, I used an iPad 8th generation (2019), it’s the 2nd to the lowest tier among the iPad lineup. Actually, let's just say it's the most basic iPad you can get. So obviously I’d be highly tempted to be moving to an iPad Pro, with a better display and a more premium feel.

Yet, I ended up still using my former iPad, the 8th generation iPad .

Why?

The 12.9″ inch screen size is just way too overwhelming and impractical. Feels impossible to use. These iPads are advertised to be a replacement of computers while I like that idealism, after experiencing for years, I believe that it does not replace a computer but acts to replicate some of its function. The ProMotion display makes the whole experience of using an app overkill.

But this screen size reason goes a long way than just due to being impractical or overwhelming , it is actually also about my relationship with the iPad.

You see, I got my first iPad in middle 2019, and it was actually an unused iPad that my dad has long stored it on his shelf. I decided to pick it up because I decided to play around with it since I was bored during the vacation.

It literally can’t do anything due to its outdated software and a storage of 16GB (yes 16 GB im not joking). I decided to just use it to watch Youtube and Netflix. It has a decent (an understatement since my laptop’s screen is actually worse than this iPad) screen due to its Retina display.

I watched a lot of my favorite movies/shows on this small screen-sized iPad. From those kdramas to my favorite films. This was also the days before I was able to listen directly from my cochlear implant.

A fun memory I had was definitely dealing with the poor Wi-Fi connection in my room. If I wanted to binge, I would have to download the episode/film beforehand. I would literally just go outside my room, sit on the couch at 10/11 PM at night with the lights off, pure silence, waiting for the device to finish downloading.

I then got to replace this iPad with the iPad 8th generation that I use now.

Think of technology as a racket. There are so many rackets nowadays in the market with so many different specifications. There’s a light or heavier model, rigid or flexible model, and so much more but it all boils down to you. The athlete, the player on court. You need to find the racket that actually suits you, unjudged by the price, trend, or people’s major opinion but by sheer compatibility and that it makes you happy. And I hope you will be able to find your own happiness with the things you use just like this guy right here, Kento Momota when he finally chose the racket he will use.
