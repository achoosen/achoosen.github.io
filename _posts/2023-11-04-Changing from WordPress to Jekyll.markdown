I got to know Jekyll because I wanted to make a website for [The Mentarian](thementarian.org). As you can tell, it has exactly the same theme as mine ;D. I knew I couldn't rely on those free website builders because not only its obvious that we are using their service but I want to make it easy for us to publish contents on our website. That's when I discovered Jekyll. Long story short, I was able to make The Mentarian website just like I envisioned it to be. Having this experience, I decided to do the same for my blog because...

# Reasons for the move
# Jekyll is intuitive

One would think making a website by writing down code just makes the process difficult but I beg to differ. Using Jekyll is pretty simple, their [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com) makes it really easy to set things up. With a sufficient knowledge in HTML, CSS, you can easily customize the website. It's main feature however is that it allows you to really focus on writing by using Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language and honestly a lot of it makes a lot of sense when writing. Additionally, one can gain portfoilo through this experience (if you know what I mean).

# The watermark

Another reason of why I made the move to Jekyll is to avoid the watermarks. I hate the "Powered by WordPress" watermark on the footer and the annoying popup at the header because it makes my website look unprofessional. If I want to remove the watermark, I would have to pay and it's not cheap. Hosting a website on GitHub Pages comes for free with the additional benefit of the website becoming your canvas (as long as you know how to code).

# Writing Math is easier

What I've been doing while using WordPress is using the ['Latex to image' website converter](https://latex2image.joeraut.com/) and the experience isn't... pleasant. I tried using the code block but it didn't seem to work. Due to frustration, this just makes me want to write less.

Adding this line of code on a Markdown file allows me to write text using Latex.
```
<script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

With this, my writing flow isn't disrupted by the tools that I use. Jekyll just makes a lot of sense.

# Why not Hugo?

The funny thing is I found Jekyll first before Hugo when I started my journey of making a blog. So it was really because I do not my research well. When I realized, I got lazy and realized that I still prefer the Minima theme anyways. 

Anyways, I think Hugo also looks great. I think one can also opt for Hugo if page load times is really a big deal for you. Otherwise, it is just a matter of preference.
