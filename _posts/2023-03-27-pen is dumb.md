So recently my dad received a pen as a gift, a fancy one rather. But the problem is that when he opened the box, he couldn’t open the pen. Now mind you, he is 55, okay maybe he’s old that’s why, I thought. So I asked him how he opened it which he demonstrated by twisting it clockwise. I thought ‘ah hes just twisting improperly” so I tried doing the same thing and it failed.

“this can’t be it” I muttered inside my head.

I searched up the pen model on the Internet. Turns out he was opening the wrong side of the pen. Okay then, I told my dad, this is where you should open it. He trusted me then he tried twisting it clockwise again but failed. I repeated the following procedure again just to make sure. It didn’t work. There was something wrong with this pen.

Until my mom came, my dad gave his pen to her, and then guess what? She opened it like it was nothing. Baffled by how easy it was for her, I asked her how she did it, she immediately showcased how she did it. Mind blown.

Can you guess what went wrong when I tried opening the pen?

The answer is: You’re actually suppoed to turn it anti-clockwise.

Throughout the flashback earlier, I emphasized on twisting clockwise which was the key in what went wrong during the event story. This story is a prime example of anchoring bias: where one has the tendency to rely heavily on the first bits of information. All this drama would not happen if I just step back and think critically,”if clockwise doesn’t work, maybe anti-clockwise works?”

I wonder how many times I perhaps commit this in my everyday life, school, and outside. Perhaps a lot of people has also experiencing falling into this logical trap as well without realizing.

What this experience taught me is to have an active mind. But it isn’t easy as it sounds as having an active mind requires practice. Habit of thinking needs to be done. I can recall the amount of times I have made a decision without verifying / thinking further what am I onto which leads to regret and cussing at myself.
