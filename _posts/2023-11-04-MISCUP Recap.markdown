*from our [October-November issue article][issue-article] about MISCUP

MISCUP is an internal athletic and intellectual contest open to all students and held between the three Mentari Schools, MISJ (Jakarta), MISB (Bintaro), and MISGS (Grand Surya). MISCUP was split over three separate days at each campus taking place on the 14th, 15th, and 28th of October, ensuring each campus received an equal share in hosting the games.

# Day 1
MISCUP opened on 14th of October with three competitions; debate, swimming, and badminton, hosted on the MISJ campus. On Day 1, MISJ was able to earn 6 first place victories, 14 second place victories, and 6 in third place, showing total dominance in debate in SMP and SMA. However MISJ is unable to find victory in badminton and swimming, falling into the dominance of MISGS and MISB respectively.

# Day 2
The next day, the 15th of October, was hosted in MISB, with basketball, mini soccer, and essay writing. The matches was unfiercingly fierce and brutal.
