<h1 class="title">Home</h1>

Donâ€™t know how to make an original welcome message for this homepage.

I basically blog about **things** and compile the Maths I've done, those I find interesting and enjoy. 

I used WordPress in the past but I've made the switch to Jekyll. I got lazy so I used the Minima Theme.
