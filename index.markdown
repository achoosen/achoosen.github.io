<h1 class="title">Home</h1>

Donâ€™t know how to make an original welcome message for this homepage.

I basically blog about **things** and compile the Maths I've done, ones I find interesting and enjoy. 

I've went from hosting my website from WordPress to GitHub Pages using Jekyll.\
(Read my post about [this]({{site.url}}/blog/2023/11/02/Changing-from-WordPress-to-Jekyll.html)).
